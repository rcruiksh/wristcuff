### Wrist Cuff

BioDev identified the utility of an all-in-one device that could monitor a patientâ€™s heart rate, blood pressure, and blood oxygen saturation levels. 
A device like this, if portable and easy to use, would find application with emergency response personnel, as well as home monitoring. 
To increase accesibility, the device will be designed to incorporate wireless data sharing technology and smartphone integration.
