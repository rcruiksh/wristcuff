# Bluetooth
testing code for bluetooth
feather example sketches contain run throughs and appropriate settings from the adafruit feather pdf
wristcuff_prototyping_arduino contains an arduino file that randomly generates values for HR, BP, SpO2%, and sends them from the feather over bluetooth in the UART mode
the two .py files are for parsing and averaging .txt data output from the feather. Probably won't need these
